# WarLight / Warzone pick combos
This is a small Java program which calculates the possible pick outcomes for 1v1 games
and an arbitrary amount of picks.


## Results
Below are results for 1 to 5 amount of starting spots. If you are interested in the possible outcome
of even more starting spots, you need to run the code yourself. In order to run the code, you need to
be able to run basic Java programs.

You need to read the result in the following way shown here for the line "[2, 3] (second)" for 2 starting spots:
* [2,3] means that you get your picks 2 and 3.
* (second) means that you must have moved second during the picking stage for that [2,3] outcome.
